\# ⚖️ Ohaus Scale Serial Data Logger

  

This application logs data from a serial device (specifically configured for Ohaus scales) and saves it to an Excel file in real-time. It features a live data dashboard, batch buffering for high-speed data, and automatic sheet switching in Excel to handle large datasets.

  

\## 📋 Prerequisites

  

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed on your PC:

  

1\. \*\*Python (version 3.8 or higher)\*\*

\* Download from \[python.org\](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

\* \*Note: During installation, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".\*

  

  

2\. \*\*A Serial Device\*\*

\* Connect your scale/device via USB or RS232-to-USB adapter.

\## ⚙️ Installation

  

1\. \*\*Create the Project Folder\*\*

\* Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., \`SerialLogger\`).

\* Save the Python script provided in this package inside that folder as \*\*\`app.py\`\*\*.

  

  

2\. \*\*Install Required Libraries\*\*

\* Open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).

\* Navigate to your folder (e.g., \`cd Desktop/SerialLogger\`).

\* Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

  

  

  

\`\`\`bash

pip install streamlit pyserial pandas openpyxl

  

\`\`\`

  

\> \*\*Note:\*\* We install \`pyserial\`, not \`serial\`. If you mistakenly installed \`serial\`, uninstall it first using \`pip uninstall serial\`.

\## 🚀 How to Run

  

1\. Open your Command Prompt/Terminal.

2\. Navigate to the folder where you saved \`app.py\`.

3\. Run the application using Streamlit:

  

\`\`\`bash

streamlit run app.py

  

\`\`\`

  

4\. A new tab should automatically open in your default web browser displaying the application.

\## 📖 User Guide

  

\### 1. Configuration (Sidebar)

  

\* \*\*Refresh Ports:\*\* Click this if you plugged in your device \*after\* starting the app.

\* \*\*Serial Port:\*\* Select the COM port your device is connected to (e.g., \`COM3\`, \`/dev/ttyUSB0\`).

\* \*\*Baud Rate:\*\* Match this to your device's settings (Default is \`9600\`).

\* \*\*Output Filename:\*\* Name of the Excel file to be generated.

\* \*\*Batch Size:\*\* Determines how many rows are held in memory before writing to Excel. Higher numbers (e.g., 2000) offer better performance for fast data streams.

  

\### 2. Operation

  

1\. Click \*\*"🚀 Start Logging"\*\*.

2\. The status will change to "Active" and the app will attempt to send a \`CP\` (Continuous Print) command to the scale.

3\. Watch the \*\*Live Data Preview\*\* to ensure data is coming in correctly.

4\. Click \*\*"🛑 Stop Logging"\*\* to safely finish the session. The app will ensure any remaining data in the buffer is written to the file before closing.

\## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

  

\*\*"Permission Denied" Error:\*\*

  

\* This usually happens if you have the \`Desorption\_Data.xlsx\` file \*\*open in Excel\*\* while the app is trying to write to it. Close the Excel file and try again.

  

\*\*"No COM ports detected":\*\*

  

\* Ensure your USB cable is plugged in securely.

\* You may need to install drivers for your specific RS232-to-USB adapter (common brands are FTDI or Prolific).

  

\*\*Data is lagging:\*\*

  

\* Increase the \*\*Batch Size\*\* in the sidebar settings. Writing to Excel is slow; doing it less frequently improves performance.
